# school-shootings-analysis

A repository for analyzing the correlation between school shooting incidents and different state-level metrics in years ranging from (2000-2023).
Note that some of the results in analysis.ipynb are interactive. For the full experience it is suggested to run the first four cells. The metrics used in this study are as follow:

## American Community Survey [2010-2019, 2021]
* Educational Attainment % (25 or older)
* Health Insurance Coverage % (18-64)
* Poverty % (18-64)

## National Survey on Drug Use and Health [2016-2019]
* Needing but not receiving Treatment for Substance Use % (18 or older)
* Serious Mental Illness % (18 or older)

## RAND Household Firearm Ownership Estimates [2000-2016]
* Household Firearm Rate

Data used from the shootings themselves include coordinates, victims (wounded/killed), date, incident subtype.
